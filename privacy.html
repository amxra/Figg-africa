                            <p>Marketing investment opportunities is essential to our services. We will notify you of investment opportunities that we think will be of interest to you, based on the information you have provided to us (including your Personal Data). We seek to maximise the number of relevant investment opportunities shown to you, which is achieved by marketing these opportunities via digital marketing, such as email.</p>
                            <p>We have undertaken a data protection impact assessment in respect of our use of digital communications for marketing purposes, and have concluded that we have a legitimate interest in carrying out direct digital marketing to our members. The method is familiar to our members and is the least intrusive one available to us. We have considered that there is no adverse impact on individuals, as our communications are only sent to those who have provided their details for the purpose of becoming a member.</p>
                            <p>However, we strive to provide our members with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt out links on any marketing message sent to you.</p>
                            <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will still process your personal data provided to us as a result of your use of our website, our services or other transactions.</p>
                            <p>Copies of data protection impact assessments or legitimate interest assessments we have undertaken are available on request by using the contact details set out at the start of this policy.</p>

                            <p>All information you provide to us via email or Our Site is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of Our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. The security of your personal data is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as bank account information) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Our Site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@figg.africa">support@figg.africa</a></p>
                            <h5>Payment security</h5>
                            <p>All payments made to Figg are processed by Paystack. Paystack conforms to the highest level of security - please see here for more details. Paystack has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.</p>
                            <h5>Security audits</h5>
                            <p>We use recognised and accredited third parties to perform regular penetration tests of our platform and also internal networks across our offices. Any output is reviewed and prioritised with high importance.</p>
                            <h5>Third party security</h5>
                            <p>Like many businesses, we use certain third‑parties to support the services we provide to our users. We constantly review the security and suitability of any third parties as part of our ongoing processes.</p>

                            <p>Figg employees are required to undertake cybersecurity awareness training and also acknowledge and be compliant with internal security processes across hardware and software. These are reviewed and updated regularly.</p>

                            <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers.</p>
                            <p>Otherwise, we will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for more than six years in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
                            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
                            <p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.</p>
                            <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further information.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Your legal rights</h4>
                            <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data (though please note that your rights may be limited under certain circumstances). For example, you may have the right to:</p>
                            <ul class="nested-list">
                                <li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                                <li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                                <li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                                <li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                                <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
                                    <ul class="nested-list">
                                        <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy. </li>
                                        <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                                        <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
                                        <li>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use, or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                                <li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
                                <li>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details provided at the start of the policy.</li>
                                <li>No fee usually required</li>
                                <li>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</li>
                                <li><h5>What we may need from you</h5>
                                    <ul class="nested-list">
                                        <li>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
                                    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
                                </li>
